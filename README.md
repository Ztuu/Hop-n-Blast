# WowieJam Entry = Hop n' Blast
## Created by Ztuu
This is a litte game I made as an entry to WowieJam hosted by Jonas Tyroller.

I basically made most of the project in the final 3 hours so some of the code may be a bit sloppy.
Submitted for jam at 8am on 4th Feb 2019, I may develop this further in the future.

The art is a free asset pack made by my friend, get it here: https://cryoscopic-e.itch.io/old-world

This repository contains the entire unity project so you should be able to download it, open it in unity and see how everything works!
